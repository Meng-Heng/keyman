2. Suggestion: the 'repair profiles' pattern should look at the list of enabled Keyman keyboards vs the list of profiles in HKCU\Control Panel\International and fixup discrepancies there. This should probably be an automatic task. This will probably fix the issues that Makara noted around missing keyboards across multiple user profiles etc.
3. uninstall and reinstall of package in same ELEVATED session of kmshell causes error
4. Review Joshua's corrections document
5. Implement Windows Updates Stage 1 -- https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/issues/10038
